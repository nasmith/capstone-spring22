# COVID-19

## Remote Access

If you are sick or have potentially been exposed to COVID-19, *stay home*. There are no attendance points in this class, so you will not be penalized for missing class to keep our community safe. 

Below, we briefly describe the accommodations for students having to miss class due to illness or exposure.

- Lecture sessions: There are very few lectures in this course; slides will be posted and, in cases where the slides are not self-contained, we will post live recordings.  Student presentations (which account for most presented material during class lectures) will not be broadcast or recorded, but there is ample opportunity to provide feedback on other students' reports via the discussion board.
- Support hours:  All support hours will be scheduled by appointment; we are happy for these to be virtual.
- Asynchronous help via the Ed discussion board:   post online to get asynchronous help from a member of the course staff or your peers.

## Masking

While in public, indoor spaces occupied by other people, you are encouraged to wear a mask. This includes, but is not limited to: class sessions, quiz sections, and support hours in an office or other meeting rooms. See more information about UWâ€˜s masking requirements [here](https://www.ehs.washington.edu/covid-19-prevention-and-response/face-covering-requirements).

## Social Distancing

Vaccinations and masking provide strong protection against the spread of COVID. At this writing, UW does not require social distancing in the classroom or office hours for students who are vaccinated and wearing a mask. The masking and vaccination requirements proved to be very strong in Autumn 2021, leading to no known documented COVID cases that came from transmission in a classroom.

Of course, some students might feel more comfortable keeping a little distance. If you would like to keep space between you and another student, please  ask them to leave a space between you and them if there is room available. Similarly, if someone asks you to maintain a space between them, please respect that request if possible.

## What if you get sick?

See [this FAQ](https://www.washington.edu/coronavirus/faq/) from UW on what you should do if you get sick. 

## What if Noah or a TA gets sick?

The course staff are committed to keeping you safe, so we will not make you risk a potential exposure to COVID to attend class. If Noah or your TA feels ill, we will not attend in person; if no course staff can attend, we may cancel a class meeting.

Please make sure you check your email and the discussion board frequently and before you attend an in-person event to make sure it is still happening in-person. We will always try our best to give notice as early as possible for any changes.
